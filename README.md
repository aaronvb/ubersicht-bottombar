# ubersicht-bottombar
A bottom bar for [Übersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/)

I took inspiration from i3 and other Ubersicht widgets to come up with this very simple bottom bar widget.

Included in the bottom bar:
- cpu
- memory
- battery life(percentage)
- network up and down
- weather based on IP or a default location
- date
- time

## Screenshot
In this screenshot I am also using [KWM](https://github.com/koekeishiya/kwm) for the window tiling manager.
