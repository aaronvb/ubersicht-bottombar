# ubersicht-bottombar
A bottom bar for [Ãœbersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/)

I took inspiration from i3 and other Ubersicht widgets to come up with this very simple bottom bar widget.

Included in the bottom bar:
- CPU
- Memory
- Battery Life (percentage)
- Network Up and Down
- Weather based on IP or a default location
- Date and Time
- Spotify Artist Name and Track (Only if Spotify is running. Does not load Spotify if not running.)

## Screenshot
In this screenshot I am also using [KWM](https://github.com/koekeishiya/kwm) for the window tiling manager.
